# CSE 115A Major Course Planner

Hi, Banana Slugs!

Welcome to **Major Course Planner**—your ultimate academic companion for planning and optimizing your course selection at UCSC (University of California, Santa Cruz). We're excited to help all Banana Slugs plan their courses effectively and make the most out of their college journey.

## Project Description

### Problems Addressed

Major Course Planner aims to tackle the following challenges faced by students:

1. **Outdated Course Names:** Over time, course names can change, leading to confusion and difficulties in selecting courses. This project ensures that students have access to up-to-date course information to make informed choices.

2. **Confusing Graduation/Declaration Requirements:** Understanding and meeting academic requirements can be confusing. Major Course Planner provides a user-friendly solution to clarify these requirements, making academic planning more efficient.

3. **Support for Transfer Students:** Transfer students often face unique challenges when integrating into a new academic environment. This application offers tailored support to help transfer students seamlessly transition into UCSC.

### High-Level Goals

The project has the following high-level goals:

1. **Set and Achieved Goals:** Empower students to set academic goals and track their progress towards graduation and major declaration, ensuring they remain on the right path throughout their academic journey.

2. **Efficient Graduation Progress Tracking:** Provide a more effective and user-friendly alternative to the current UCSC portal's graduation progress tracker, making it easier for students to understand their academic status.

3. **Personalized Class Recommendations:** Offer students tailored class recommendations for the upcoming quarter based on their academic status, helping them make informed decisions about their course selection.

4. **Secure Class Records:** Allow users to save a record of the classes they have taken, ensuring that their academic history is accessible and organized within their own account.

### Project Structure

The project is organized into two main folders:

- **course-planner:** This folder contains the source code for the Major Course Planner web application.

- **Reports:** This folder includes important project reports, such as the release plan, unit testing documentation, sprint plans, and burn-up charts. These reports provide insights into the project's development process and progress.

Major Course Planner is developed as part of the course **CSE115A: Introduction to Software Engineering** at UCSC and is dedicated to improving the academic planning and course selection process for UCSC students, ensuring they have the tools and resources needed to succeed in their academic journey.

To access all the functions of this website, you need to create and log into an account. After inputting all the classes you've taken and the classes you are taking this quarter, the “Next Quarter Planner” page can provide you with recommendations for the next quarter.

Good luck on your college path!
